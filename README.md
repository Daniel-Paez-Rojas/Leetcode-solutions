## 🛠️ Problem-Solving Approach

To tackle Leetcode problems effectively, I follow a structured process that ensures clarity, efficiency, and learning.

💡 First of all I use the **Pomodoro Technique** focused work sessions. This helps me stay productive, avoid burnout and basically making a less time and energy consuming problem solving. Typically, I work in 25-minute intervals, followed by a 5-minute break.
Resources: [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/) or [Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/)

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. ### 🧠 **Understand the Problem**
   - Read the problem statement carefully. If you're having difficulty with English, you might consider using [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/es/translator) translator, a way better alternative than Google translator.
   - Re-read the statement highlighting key concepts, constraints, and requirements. Identify the **inputs** and **outputs** desired for the problem.
   - You can use the snipping tool (Windows) or any other alternatives for Mac/Linux to capture any relevant information.
   - Simplify and divide the problem into smaller ones always if is possible. Divide and conquer!
   - A good way of knowing if you truly understand the problem is imaging that you are teaching somebody else the problems with your own words.

2. 📝 **Analyze Inputs and Outputs**
   - Study the provided examples to fully understand the expected behavior.
   - Create additional test cases, including edge cases (e.g., empty inputs, maximum values) to deepen your understanding of the problem if needed.
   - Sketch a **flowchart** or diagram to visualize the input-output flow. These are some useful tools you may include for this taks:
     - [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/)
     - [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)
     - [Figma](https://www.figma.com)
     - [AlgoMonster](https://algo.monster/) - A highly useful tool not just for creating flowcharts, but also for understanding the best data structures, algorithms, and other problem-solving techniques.

   - If you're still having trouble understanding the problem, you could ask tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) or [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app/). They can help you break down the problem and offer alternative perspectives, making it easier to grasp and approach the solution.

3. 🧩 **Identify the Problem Type**
   - Categorize the problem:
     - Is it related to **search**, **sorting**, **optimization**, or any other common type?
   - Identify patterns or techniques that could be applicable:
     - **Sliding window**, **divide and conquer**, **dynamic programming**, among others.

4. 🛠️ **Choose the Right Data Structures**
   - Decide which data structures are best suited for the problem:
     - **Arrays**, **hash maps**, **heaps**, **trees**, **graphs**, etc.
   - Evaluate their time and space complexities for any scenario needed.
   - [This](https://algo.monster/flowchart) is a use ful resource for deciding wich data structure, pattern or algorithm should you use.

5. ✍️ **Draft a Direct Solution**
   - Make with pseudocode the easiest and more straightforward solution identifying the time and space complexity. This will help you later to find better solutions.
   - Identify potential inefficiencies or bottlenecks.

6. ⚡ **Optimize the Solution**
   - Explore ways to improve the algorithm:
     - Can a better data structure reduce complexity?
     - Can redundant computations be avoided?
   - Compare alternative approaches and choose the most efficient one.

7. 🧪 **Test with Pseudocode**
   - Validate the optimized solution using test cases on paper or in pseudocode.
   - Ensure it handles all edge cases correctly.

8. 🧑‍💻 **Implement the Solution in Code**
   - Translate the pseudocode into your preferred programming language.
   - Ensure the code is clean, modular, and follows best practices.

9. 🔧 **Refactor for Clarity**
   - Simplify complex logic and improve code readability.
   - Add comments to explain key sections of the code.

10. ✅ **Submit and Review**
    - Submit the solution on Leetcode.
    - Review other users' solutions to learn alternative approaches.

11. 📘 **Learn and Practice**
    - Study better solutions, focusing on techniques or optimizations you may have missed.
    - Reimplement those solutions to solidify your understanding.

12. 🔄 **Iterate and Improve**
    - If new insights or patterns emerge, revisit and refine your solution.
    - Keep iterating until you’re confident it’s the best possible approach.

### 📝 Note

If you're feeling stuck or frustrated during the process, consider taking a longer break or continuing the next day. Sometimes, giving your mind some rest leads to better solutions. Don’t forget to stay active with regular exercise, and make sure you're getting enough sleep  and proper nutrition and hydration. Believe it or not this will help you solve problems more effectively.

By following this systematic process, I ensure that my solutions are not only correct but also efficient and well-documented.
